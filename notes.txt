Few things

I want to set up GDT, IDT and Paging

I have a boot PGD and PGT set up, this is good for now but eventually I will need to unmap PGT

GDT and IDT should never be unmapped, so how does PFR work
    Page Descriptor and make it permenantly have an owner
    I guess I don't have to worry about this now, Can worry about all this when I set up PFR

1. Write new GDT and set it
2. Write new IDT and set it
3. Replace boot PGD and PGT with more permanent mapping of entire kernel space
4. Work on Page frame allocation and page frame reclamation
        Kernel Image should always be preseent since, well where else could it go?
        Swap space maybe?? Probably not
5.
